</p>

Thank you for helping keep CyberDeck secure.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied on a best-effort basis for:

| Branch/Version | Status |
|---|---|
| Latest release | Supported |
| `main` | Supported |
| Older releases | No guarantee |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly before coordinated handling.

Preferred channels:

1. Private GitHub security advisory:  
   <https://github.com/Overl1te/CyberDeck/security/advisories/new>
2. If unavailable, contact maintainer directly:  
   <https://github.com/Overl1te>

## Report should include

- concise issue description;
- reproduction steps;
- potential impact;
- affected versions/commits;
- possible mitigation/fix idea (if known).

## Response SLA (best effort)

| Stage | Target |
|---|---|
| Acknowledgement | within 72 hours |
| Initial triage | within 7 days |
| Fix/mitigation plan | within 14 days |

Complex cases may require more time.

## Disclosure policy

- Fix coordination first, public disclosure second.
- Reporter credit is provided on request.
- Post-fix details may be published for transparency.
